<h1>BÃ¶wlink</h1>

A project for the 'pant'-sponsored bowling class-trip, to track highscores & award a prize towards the end.
Rather quickly made in Unity, using Linq to sort.
Can sort by first, second or third round result.

On sorting by first, triggers a 'Winner' message notification and fireworks.
Entries can be deleted by toggling 'Danger Mode' & clicking their respective 'Kill' buttons. (Not visualized here)
